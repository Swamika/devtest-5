# Dev Test 5

## Scenario

You have been tasked with retrieving and displaying the device id of the iOS or Android device.

You have written the device specific code but you need to find a way to call it from the shared project.

## Your Task
In your pull request
* Fix the code so that it displays the device id on iOS and Android.
* Attach screenshots of the device simulators to the pull request showing the device id.

## Constraints
* Do not use any additional libraries (no additional nuget packages).
